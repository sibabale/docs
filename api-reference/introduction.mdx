---

<Warning>
 This API is currently in its early stages of development. It is maintained by a single developer and may not be stable. Features and endpoints are subject to change without notice. Please use with caution and report any issues to the maintainer.
</Warning>

## Base URL

The Banker API is built on **REST** principles. We enforce **HTTPS** in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support **HTTP**.

All requests contain the following base URL:

```
https://api.bankerapi.com
```

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an **Authorization** header with the contents of the header being `Bearer ba_123456789` where `ba_123456789`   is the default API Key.

<Note>
We are currently using a static token for authentication due to the early stages of development. This approach will be replaced with a more secure method in the future.
</Note>


```
Authorization: Bearer ba_123456789
```

## Response codes

Banker uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, `2xx` HTTP codes correspond to success, `4xx` codes are for user-related failures, and `5xx` codes are for infrastructure issues.

| Status Code | Description                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `200`         | Successful request.                  |
| `400`         | Check that the parameters were correct. |
| `401`         | The API key used was missing.        |
| `403`         | The API key used was invalid.        |
| `404`         | The resource was not found.          |
| `429`         | The rate limit was exceeded.         |
| `500`         | Indicates an error with Banker servers. |


## Rate limit

The default maximum rate limit is **2 requests per second**. This number can be increased for trusted senders by request. After that, youâ€™ll hit the rate limit and receive a `429` response error code.
